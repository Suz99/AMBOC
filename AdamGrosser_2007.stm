AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 120.85 130.50 <o,f0,male> because(2) using ammonia you get {SMACK} hugely high pressures if you {NOISE} heated them wrong {NOISE} it <sil> topped four hundred {NOISE} psi {BREATH} the ammonia was toxic it sprayed everywhere(2) <sil> but {UH} it {BREATH} was(2) kind of an(2) interesting thought <sil> (AdamGrosser_2007-120.85-130.50-F0_M-S1)
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 131.38 137.16 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} so <sil> the great thing about two thousand and six is {BREATH} there's <sil> a lot of {UH} really great computational work you can(2) do {NOISE} so we {SMACK} <sil> (AdamGrosser_2007-131.38-137.16-F0_M-S1)
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 137.63 150.34 <o,f0,male> got the whole {SMACK} thermodynamics department at stanford involved a(2) {BREATH} lot of computational fluid(2) dynamics we proved {BREATH} that most of the(2) ammonia refrigeration tables {SMACK} are {NOISE} wrong {BREATH} we {UH} found some non toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures {BREATH} (AdamGrosser_2007-137.63-150.34-F0_M-S1)
